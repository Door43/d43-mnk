Some believers who fled from the **persecution** in **Jerusalem** went far away to the **city of Antioch** and preached about **Jesus**. Most of the people in Antioch were not **Jews**, but for the first time, very many of them also became believers. **Barnabas** and **Saul** went there to teach these new believers more about Jesus and to **strengthen the church**. It was at Antioch that believers in Jesus were first called “**Christians**.”
